```plaintext
You shuttle between diversified devices all day, Android phone, iPad, Linux laptop, Windows PC, and more.
You want to transfer content from one device to another, a copy of file, a piece of text, but hesitate.
 * Your phone connects to cellular network, but your iPad doesn't.
 * Your iPad has Bluetooth support, but not for file transmitting.
 * Your laptop can link through a cable, but your phone lacks such an interface.
 * Your most devices can connect to the same Wi-Fi, except your PC is far at home.
You stuck. You scream. You come to *Kuroport* for rescue.
